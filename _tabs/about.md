Hey there, I'm Byrn Baker, a network engineer with a [CCIE](https://www.credly.com/badges/2720ca56-f1b0-4cfa-a81a-1c5603aa92d9) under my belt. When I'm not in the professional arena, you'll often find me knee-deep in my HomeLab, experimenting with new setups and configurations.

By day, I'm part of the team at a major service provider, where I help keep networks running smoothly and efficiently for our clients. It's a fast-paced world, but I thrive on the challenges it brings.
