# who am I?
Hey! I’m Byrn Baker, a [CCIE](https://www.credly.com/badges/2720ca56-f1b0-4cfa-a81a-1c5603aa92d9) network engineer. I keep provider networks reliable by day and tinker in my homelab by night, experimenting with new setups and sharing what I learn.


# Romans Road
1. **Romans 3:23**: All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God
2. **Romans 5:23**: Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, in this way death spread to all people, because all sinned
3. **Romans 6:23**: The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord
4. **Romans 5:8**: God proves his own love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us
6. **Romans 10:9-10**: If you confess with your mouth, ‘Jesus is Lord,’ and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. One believes with the heart, resulting in righteousness, and one confesses with the mouth, resulting in salvation
7. **Romans 10:13**: Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved
8. **Romans 5:1**: Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ
