# Nautobot Workshop Blog Series

**Nautobot Workshop** is a hands-on blog series for building a fully automated network lab using Nautobot, Containerlab, and Docker. Starting with a basic Ubuntu setup, each post walks through:

- Deploying Nautobot via `nautobot-docker-compose`
- Modeling topologies with Containerlab and vrnetlab routers
- Populating Nautobot with real device data using Ansible
- Generating configurations with Jinja2 templates
- Enforcing compliance with the Golden Config plugin
- Leveraging Nautobotâ€™s GraphQL API for dynamic inventory

This series is perfect for network engineers aiming to combine source of truth, automation, and simulation in a streamlined workflow.

ðŸš€ All project files are available in this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/byrn-baker/Nautobot-Workshop)


## Part 8 - Nautobot Golden Configuration - Configuration Backups
Now that we have our containerlabs topology fully functions with a base configuration, we can walk through setting up the Nautobot Golden Configuration application and perform a configuration backup of each node.

You can read more about the [Nautobot Golden Configuration App here.](https://docs.nautobot.com/projects/golden-config/en/latest/)

Before configuring any of the Golden Configuration setting we need to create a Git token secret and github repo inside our Nautobot sandbox. Navigate over to the Secrets menu and select the blue plus sign creating a new secret. Provide a name and in the provider section use Environment Variable, and in the parameters sections under "Form" type in the variable being used for you github token.

> When creating a token in github make sure the token can read and write to your repositories. The Nautobot Golden Configuration App will place files into this repository when performing backups of your router configs.
> The environment variables will need to be placed in your ```nautobot-docker-compose/environments/creds.env``` file.
> You will need the following:
> - GITHUB_TOKEN=!your token here!
> - NAPALM_USERNAME=admin
> - NAPALM_PASSWORD=admin
> - DEVICE_SECRET=admin
> The Napalm user and password will be used by the Golden Configuration application to log in to your routers.

Next create a secrets group by using the blue plus sign and from the Access type drop down select HTTP(s), from the secrets type use "token", and select your github secret from the Secrets dropdown.

Now click the Extensibility menu and then the Git Repositories blue plus sign under "DATA SOURCES" to add your github repository. 

Give a name and in the remote URL use the HTTP option from the github green code button under Local Clone. Use the branch where you would like to keep this data, and then select all of the "provides" you would like to sync between nautobot and this repository, leave the jinja templates unselected. In my example I have select all options, but the "jinja templates" because we will use most of them in this series.

> You will want to create two folders in your Repos root, "jobs" and "backup-configs". In the jobs folder create a blank file called ```__initi__.py```. It is important for this specific example that you at least select backup configs.
{: .prompt-tip }

At the bottom click the create & sync button. If all goes well you should see a completed status on this job.

We need to create a graphql that will be used to pull the data, the [Golden Configuration documentation provides one](https://docs.nautobot.com/projects/golden-config/en/latest/user/app_feature_sotagg/#performance) that we can use for now. Still under Extensibility click the blue plus sign on GraphQL Queries, give it a name and paste the query.

<img src="/assets/img/nautobot_workshop/graphql_query.webp" alt="">

```graphql
query ($device_id: ID!) {
  device(id: $device_id) {
    config_context
    hostname: name
    position
    serial
    role {
      name
    }
    primary_ip4 {
      id
      primary_ip4_for {
        id
        name
      }
    }
    tenant {
      name
    }
    tags {
      name
    }
    role {
      name
    }
    platform {
      name
      network_driver
      manufacturer {
        name
      }
      network_driver
      napalm_driver
    }
    location {
      name
      parent {
        name
      }
    }
    interfaces {
      description
      mac_address
      enabled
      mgmt_only
      cf_ospf_network_type
      cf_ospf_area
      cf_mpls_enabled
      name
      ip_addresses {
        address
        tags {
          id
        }
      }
      tagged_vlans {
        id
      }
      untagged_vlan {
        id
      }
      connected_interface {
        name
        device {
          name
        }
      }
      tags {
        id
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Now select the Golden Config Settings under the Golden Config menu, there should already be a settings called "default". We will use this for our example. Click on this and edit using the edit button on the top right. Under the Backup Configuration section from the backup repository drop down choose the repository we just created, and for the backup path we will use this in our form - ```backup-configs/{{obj.location.name|slugify}}/{{obj.name}}.cfg```. We can leave the Backup Test checked. Under the Templates Configuration section in the SOT AGG Query dropdown choose the graphql we just created above. Once done click update.

Now navigate over to the JOBS menu and select Jobs. We will need to enable all of the Nautobot Golden Configuration Jobs so that we can use them later and the Backup configs job now. Select each one by checking each check mark, and clicking edit at the bottom left of the page (edit selected). On the top choose YES in the attributes called Enabled and click apply at the bottom right.

Now click the Backup Configurations job at the top of the list. From the platform section choose both the EOS and IOS platforms and click the Run Job Now button on the bottom right.
<img src="/assets/img/nautobot_workshop/backup-job.webp" alt="">

If we have done everything correctly we should see this job end with a status of completed, and in the logs you will see that each router was logged into and configs we retrieved and backed up. These backups will be synced to your repository under the ```backup-config``` folder.

## Conclusion
In this post, we demonstrated how to integrate the Nautobot Golden Configuration application into our automated lab environment to perform configuration backups across network devices. By setting up secrets, linking a GitHub repository, creating a GraphQL query, and configuring the Golden Config settings, we established a reliable and repeatable workflow for capturing and storing device configurations. This ensures that our lab remains consistent and version-controlled, while also laying the foundation for future compliance checks and configuration drift detection. With backups now automatically pushed to Git, weâ€™re one step closer to a fully operational, automated network lab built on Nautobot.
