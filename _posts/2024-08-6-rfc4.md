Continuing a look back on Networking Group RFCs we find [RFC 4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4.txt). Picture this: it's almost 55 years ago, and the concept of a network as we know it is just beginning to take shape. Let’s dive into this fascinating piece of history and see what it took to lay the groundwork for what would become the modern internet.

### So, what’s RFC 4 all about?

RFC 4, published by Elmer B. Shapiro from Stanford Research Institute, is essentially a detailed schedule for setting up a network system. Imagine it as a comprehensive to-do list for early network engineers. It outlines everything from installing communication gear to testing network messages.

Let’s break it down: What are the main phases?

The document is organized into phases, each with specific tasks and deadlines. Here’s a quick overview:

1. **Network Setup**: The initial phase involves checking network gear, installing communication equipment, and setting up power systems. This starts with getting the necessary specs from AT&T and BBN and ends with installing the equipment by August 1969.

2. **Host-IMP Interface Design**: By September 1969, the focus shifts to designing and constructing the host-IMP interface. This involves getting specifications from BBN, developing trial designs, and debugging both hardware and software.

3. **IMP Installation**: Also in September 1969, they begin installing IMPs, which were crucial for routing messages between different network nodes.

4. **Testing and Debugging**: Testing is a significant part of the plan. The document details steps for testing messages between various institutions, including UCLA and UCSB. This includes checking message integrity, sequence, delays, and developing voice coordination schemes.

5. **Expanding the Network**: By the end of 1969, testing expands to include nodes in Utah and other locations. This phase also focuses on user access, from simple TTY systems to more complex configurations, and refining debugging techniques.

### Why is this important?

RFC 4 is a fascinating glimpse into the meticulous planning that went into the early days of network development. It shows how foundational work was crucial in setting up a reliable and efficient network. The thorough approach to testing, debugging, and user access planning highlights the complexity and foresight involved in building what we now take for granted as the internet.

### Any standout details?

One notable aspect is the detailed approach to debugging. The RFC outlines various techniques for fault detection, cause localization, and correction. They even mention using voice coordination channels and dial-up Dataphone for troubleshooting. It’s incredible to see how detailed their planning was.

### What Else was Happening?
- Francis Turner was sworn in as the director of the Federal Highway Administration. This event marked a significant change in leadership for the agency responsible for the development and maintenance of the U.S. highway system.
- The song "Dizzy" by Tommy Roe was the number one song on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. This song became a major hit and a cultural touchstone of the time.
