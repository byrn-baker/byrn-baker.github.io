Continuing our journey through the early days of networking with a look at [RFC 2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2txt), titled "Host Software" (again!). This document, penned by Bill Duvall on April 9, 1969, built upon the foundational ideas introduced in RFC 1. It’s a testament to the collaborative spirit and rapid evolution of ideas that characterized the nascent days of the Internet.

### Setting the Scene
In the late 1960s, the idea of networking computers was still in its infancy. The ARPANET project was just getting started, aiming to connect research computers at universities and laboratories across the United States. But how do you ensure these machines can communicate smoothly? Enter RFC 2, which took the conversation about host software to the next level.

### The Vision of RFC 2
RFC 2 was all about refining the ideas introduced in RFC 1. It focused on providing a more detailed blueprint for the software that each host computer would need to implement to interact over the ARPANET. While RFC 1 laid the groundwork by introducing the need for network protocols, RFC 2 delved into more specific details about how these protocols might work.

Bill Duvall’s RFC 2 emphasized the necessity for host computers to handle multiple conversations at once. Imagine a crowded room where everyone is talking simultaneously, yet everyone can follow their own conversation without getting lost. That’s the level of sophistication needed for the ARPANET to function effectively.

### Multiplexing: The Key Concept
One of the key concepts introduced in RFC 2 was multiplexing. Multiplexing is like giving each conversation its own dedicated line, ensuring that messages don’t get mixed up or lost in the digital ether. This idea was crucial for allowing multiple users to access resources and communicate concurrently without interference.

By laying out these ideas, RFC 2 contributed to the development of protocols that would eventually lead to the creation of the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), which underpins much of our modern Internet communication.

### A Collaborative Spirit
Just like RFC 1, RFC 2 was written in an informal, exploratory style. This approach encouraged feedback, experimentation, and collaboration. The creators of these early RFCs knew that they were entering uncharted territory and that the best way forward was to work together, share ideas, and iterate quickly.

The informal tone and collaborative nature of these early documents helped foster a community-driven environment, allowing researchers and engineers from different institutions to contribute to and refine the protocols that would shape the future of networking.

### Reflections on Progress
Looking back, it’s fascinating to see how quickly things evolved. Within just a few days of RFC 1, RFC 2 pushed the conversation forward, highlighting the dynamic and fast-paced nature of the ARPANET project. This iterative process of refinement and collaboration became a hallmark of the Internet's development, leading to rapid advancements and innovations.


### What Else was Happening?
- **The Internet's First RFC**: As we discussed earlier, RFC 1, titled "Host Software," was published by Steve Crocker. This document marked the beginning of the Internet's development, setting the foundation for network protocols.
- ***Ted Kennedy Announces Presidential Candidacy***: Senator Ted Kennedy announced he would not run for the Democratic nomination for President in 1972 due to his scandal in allowing a young women (Mary Jo Kopechne) to drown in his car at the bottom of the Chappaquiddick.
- **Birth of the Internet Meme "It's Not Rocket Science"**: In a humorous column published in the British magazine Punch, the phrase "It's not rocket science" was first documented, becoming a popular expression to denote something simple compared to rocket science.
- **Beginning of the World Health Organization's Assembly**: The 22nd World Health Assembly opened in Boston, where representatives from various countries gathered to discuss global health issues. This assembly played a significant role in shaping international health policies, which probably has been a major negative on the rest of us since then.
