Update on a couple of things I did to help the Design Builder App fully deploy the intial data needed for this Nautobot Workshop.

## The Challenge: BGP Peering Complexity

The Nautobot Design Builder app comes with a BGP peering extension, but it had limitations when dealing with real-world BGP configurations. Specifically, the original extension didn't properly handle:

- Peer groups with all necessary attributes
- Source interface references
- Local IP address assignments
- Comprehensive endpoint descriptions
- Complex BGP peer configurations with multiple address families

For my workshop, I needed to create a comprehensive BGP infrastructure that would demonstrate realistic network topologies with proper peer group configurations and interface bindings.

## The Solution: Custom Extension Development

### Creating the Enhanced BGP Template

First, I developed a comprehensive Jinja2 template that could handle complex BGP configurations:

```yaml
{% raw %}
autonomous_systems:
{% for device in bgp_routing if device.bgp is defined %}
  - "!create_or_update:asn": {{ device.bgp.asn }}
    description: {{ device.bgp.description | default("ASN for " ~ device.name) }}
    status__name: Active
    "!ref": "{{ device.name | lower | replace('-', '_') }}_{{ device.bgp.asn }}"
{% endfor %}

bgp_routing_instances:
{% for device in bgp_routing if device.bgp is defined %}
  - "!create_or_update:device": "!ref:{{ device.name | lower | replace('-', '_') }}"
    "!ref": "{{ device.name | lower | replace('-', '_') }}_{{ device.bgp.asn }}_ri"
    autonomous_system__asn: {{ device.bgp.asn }}
    status__name: Active
    router_id: "!ref:{{ device.name | lower | replace('-', '_') }}_loopback0_ipv4"
{% endfor %}

bgp_address_families:
{% for device in bgp_routing if device.bgp is defined %}
  {% for af in device.bgp.afi_safi %}
  - "!create_or_update:afi_safi": {{ af.afi_safi }}
    routing_instance: "!ref:{{ device.name | lower | replace('-', '_') }}_{{ device.bgp.asn }}_ri"
    {% if af.extra_attributes is defined %}
    extra_attributes:
{% for key, value in af.extra_attributes.items() %}
      {{ key }}: {{ value }}
{% endfor %}
    {% endif %}
  {% endfor %}
{% endfor %}

bgp_peer_groups:
{% for device in bgp_routing if device.bgp is defined %}
  {% for pg in device.bgp.bgp_peer_groups %}
  - "!create:name": {{ pg.name }}
    "!ref": "{{ device.name | lower | replace('-', '_') }}_{{ device.bgp.asn }}_{{ pg.name | lower | replace('-', '_') }}_pg"
    routing_instance: "!ref:{{ device.name | lower | replace('-', '_') }}_{{ device.bgp.asn }}_ri"
    autonomous_system__asn: {{ pg.peer_asn }}
    enabled: true
    {% if pg.local_interface is defined %}
    source_interface: "!ref:{{ device.name | lower | replace('-', '_') }}_{{ pg.local_interface | lower | replace('/', '_') | replace('-', '_') }}"
    {% endif %}
    {% if pg.extra_attributes is defined %}
    extra_attributes:
          {% for key, value in pg.extra_attributes.items() %}
      {{ key }}: {{ value }}
          {% endfor %}
        {% endif %}
  {% endfor %}
{% endfor %}

bgp_peer_group_address_families:
{% for device in bgp_routing if device.bgp is defined %}
  {% for pg in device.bgp.bgp_peer_groups %}
    {% if pg.afi_safi is defined %}
      {% for af in pg.afi_safi %}
  - "!create:afi_safi": {{ af.afi_safi }}
    peer_group: "!ref:{{ device.name | lower | replace('-', '_') }}_{{ device.bgp.asn }}_{{ pg.name | lower | replace('-', '_') }}_pg"
    import_policy: {{ pg.in_route_map }}
    export_policy: {{ pg.out_route_map }}
    multipath: true
        {% if af.extra_attributes is defined %}
    extra_attributes:
          {% for key, value in af.extra_attributes.items() %}
      {{ key }}: {{ value }}
          {% endfor %}
        {% endif %}
      {% endfor %}
    {% endif %}
  {% endfor %}
{% endfor %}

{% macro bgp_peer_endpoint(dev, asn, intf, ip, peer_group, peer_dev, peer_intf, device_ctx=None) -%}
routing_instance: "!ref:{{ dev | lower | replace('-', '_') }}_{{ asn }}_ri"
source_interface: "!ref:{{ dev | lower | replace('-', '_') }}_{{ intf | lower | replace('/', '_') | replace('-', '_') }}"
source_ip: "!ref:{{ dev | lower | replace('-', '_') }}_{{ intf | lower | replace('/', '_') | replace('-', '_') }}_{{ 'ipv4' if ':' not in ip else 'ipv6' }}"
{% if peer_group and device_ctx %}
peer_group: "!ref:{{ device_ctx | lower | replace('-', '_') }}_{{ asn }}_{{ peer_group | lower | replace('-', '_') }}_pg"
{% endif %}
description: {{ peer_dev }}_{{ peer_intf }}
{%- endmacro %}

{% set seen = namespace(keys=[]) %}
bgp_peerings:
{% for device in bgp_routing if device.bgp is defined and device.bgp.bgp_peers is defined %}
  {% set local_dev = device.name %}
  {% set local_asn = device.bgp.asn %}
  {% for peer in device.bgp.bgp_peers %}
    {% set peer_dev = peer.peer_device %}
    {% set peer_asn = peer.peer_asn if peer.peer_asn is defined else (
        (bgp_routing | selectattr("name", "equalto", peer_dev) | map(attribute="bgp.asn") | list | first)
    ) %}
    {% set local_ip = peer.local_address %}
    {% set peer_ip = peer.peer_address %}
    {% set local_intf = peer.local_interface %}
    {% set peer_intf = peer.peer_interface %}
    {% set local_peer_group = peer.local_peer_group if peer.local_peer_group is defined else None %}
    {% set remote_peer_group = peer.remote_peer_group if peer.remote_peer_group is defined else None %}
    {% set description = peer_dev ~ "_" ~ peer_intf %}
    {% set endpoints = [
      local_dev, local_asn, local_intf, local_ip, local_peer_group or '',
      peer_dev, peer_asn, peer_intf, peer_ip, remote_peer_group or ''
    ] %}
    {% set peering_key = endpoints | map('string') | sort | join('__') %}
    {% if peering_key not in seen.keys %}
      {% set _ = seen.keys.append(peering_key) %}
- "!bgp_peering":
    endpoints:
      - {{ bgp_peer_endpoint(local_dev, local_asn, local_intf, local_ip, local_peer_group, local_dev) | indent(8, false) }}
      - {{ bgp_peer_endpoint(peer_dev, peer_asn, peer_intf, peer_ip, remote_peer_group, peer_dev) | indent(8, false) }}
    status__name: "Active"
    {% endif %}
  {% endfor %}
{% endfor %}
{% endraw %}
```

This template systematically creates all the necessary BGP components, from autonomous systems to peer groups and individual peerings.

### The Key Innovation: Enhanced Peer Endpoint Building
The core improvement was in the ```build_peer_endpoint``` method of the BGPPeeringExtension class:

```python
def build_peer_endpoint(self, endpoint_data):
    """Build or look up a PeerEndpoint using !refs, ModelInstances, or filters."""
    endpoint = dict(endpoint_data)

    # Handle routing instance resolution
    if "routing_instance" in endpoint:
        endpoint["routing_instance"] = self.resolve_or_create(self.RoutingInstance, endpoint["routing_instance"])
    elif any(k.startswith("routing_instance__") for k in endpoint.keys()):
        ri_filter = {k.replace("routing_instance__", ""): endpoint.pop(k) for k in list(endpoint) if k.startswith("routing_instance__")}
        endpoint["routing_instance"] = self.resolve_or_create(self.RoutingInstance, ri_filter)

    # Handle peer group resolution
    if "peer_group" in endpoint:
        endpoint["peer_group"] = self.resolve_or_create(self.PeerGroup, endpoint["peer_group"])
    elif "peer_group__name" in endpoint:
        ri = endpoint["routing_instance"]
        endpoint["peer_group"] = self.resolve_or_create(
            self.PeerGroup,
            {
                "name": endpoint.pop("peer_group__name"),
                "routing_instance": ri,
            },
        )

    # Handle source interface and IP resolution
    if "source_interface" in endpoint:
        endpoint["source_interface"] = self.resolve_or_create(
            self.Interface,
            endpoint["source_interface"],
        )

    if "source_ip" in endpoint:
        endpoint["source_ip"] = self.resolve_or_create(
            self.IPAddress,
            endpoint["source_ip"],
        )

    return self.PeerEndpoint(self.environment, endpoint)
```

This enhanced method properly resolves all the complex relationships needed for realistic BGP peering configurations.

### Testing the Solution: Docker Development Environment
One of the most elegant aspects of this solution was how easy it was to test changes using Docker. Here's the docker-compose configuration that made development seamless:

```yaml
services:
  nautobot:
    command: "nautobot-server runserver 0.0.0.0:8080"
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    volumes:
      - "../config/nautobot_config.py:/opt/nautobot/nautobot_config.py"
      - "../jobs:/opt/nautobot/jobs"
      - "../custom_jinja_filters:/opt/nautobot/custom_jinja_filters"
      - "../custom_python_code/custom_ext.py:/usr/local/lib/python${PYTHON_VER}/site-packages/nautobot_design_builder/contrib/ext.py"
    healthcheck:
      interval: "30s"
      timeout: "10s"
      start_period: "60s"
      retries: 3
      test: ["CMD", "true"]
      
  celery_worker:
    volumes:
      - "../config/nautobot_config.py:/opt/nautobot/nautobot_config.py"
      - "../jobs:/opt/nautobot/jobs"
      - "../custom_jinja_filters:/opt/nautobot/custom_jinja_filters"
      - "../custom_python_code/custom_ext.py:/usr/local/lib/python${PYTHON_VER}/site-packages/nautobot_design_builder/contrib/ext.py"
```

The key insight here is the volume mapping that replaces the default ```ext.py``` file with our custom version:

```
"../custom_python_code/custom_ext.py:/usr/local/lib/python${PYTHON_VER}/site-packages/nautobot_design_builder/contrib/ext.py"
```

This approach allowed me to rapidly iterate on the extension code without rebuilding containers or complex installation procedures.

### The Results: Complex BGP Topologies Made Simple
With these enhancements, I could create sophisticated BGP configurations using simple YAML definitions:

```yaml
- "!bgp_peering":
    endpoints:
      - routing_instance: "!ref:rr1_65000_ri"
        source_interface: "!ref:rr1_loopback0"
        source_ip: "!ref:rr1_loopback0_ipv4"
        peer_group: "!ref:backbone_rr_ipv4_peers_pg"
        description: rr1_loopback0
      - routing_instance: "!ref:p1_65000_ri"
        source_interface: "!ref:p1_loopback0"
        source_ip: "!ref:p1_loopback0_ipv4"
        peer_group: "!ref:backbone_rr_ipv4_peers_pg"
        description: p1_loopback0
    status__name: "Active"
```

This creates fully functional BGP peerings with proper peer group associations, interface bindings, and IP address assignments.

## Conclusion
The Nautobot Design Builder app provides a strong foundation for building complex network data models. By extending its capabilities and contributing back to the community, we can make it even more powerful for real-world networking scenarios.

This was my first time contributing updates to a project I didn‚Äôt originally create, and it was a rewarding experience. The enhanced BGP peering extension I developed for my workshop highlights how custom extensions can address sophisticated networking requirements while preserving the clarity and flexibility that make Nautobot such a compelling tool.

Whether you're preparing for a workshop, automating production infrastructure, or exploring new ways to model network designs, the combination of Nautobot, the Design Builder app, and custom extensions offers a robust and adaptable platform for network automation.
