## ARPA: A brief history

The Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) was established in 1958 by the United States Department of Defense. Its primary goal was to develop and apply advanced technology to prevent technological surprise in the event of a Soviet attack. ARPA's early focus was on developing computer networks, which would eventually become the foundation for the modern internet.

In the late 1960s, ARPA-funded researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), the Stanford Research Institute (SRI), and the University of Hawaii created the first operational packet switching network, called ARPANET. This was a pioneering effort in computer networking, laying the groundwork for modern communication networks.

As ARPA evolved, its name changed to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in 1972. DARPA continued to fund research projects, including the development of packet switching networks, which became the foundation for modern internet infrastructure.

In the 1990s, DARPA's focus shifted to more applied research, such as the development of advanced technologies like autonomous vehicles and artificial intelligence. Today, DARPA is a leading funder of cutting-edge research in areas like cybersecurity, biotechnology, and space exploration, robotics, and artificial intelligence.

## DNS: The Key to Domain Names

In the 1980s, as the internet began to take shape, the need for a system that could translate human-readable domain names (e.g., google.com) into IP addresses (e.g., 216.58.194.174) became apparent. This is where DNS comes in.

DNS (Domain Name System) is often referred to as a decentralized system, but in reality, it has a hierarchical structure controlled by only a few organizations. The root domain, for instance, is managed by just 13 organizations known as "root servers." These root servers are operated by a few large organizations, including VeriSign, ICANN, RIPE.NCC, APNIC, ARIN, and LACNIC.

This hierarchical structure allows for the collection of metadata from every user who accesses the internet. As you navigate the web, your device is constantly querying DNS to resolve domain names into IP addresses. This process leaves a trail of breadcrumbs, including information about where you're located, what sites you visit, and how long you stay there.

The owners of this technology have access to an unprecedented amount of information about everyone who uses the internet. This metadata can be used to build detailed profiles of your online activities, interests, and habits. And with great power comes great control – the owners of the DNS infrastructure can use this information to influence what you see, where you go, and even how you think.

## The Watchers: An  Analogy

Now, let's turn our attention to the account of the Watchers from the Book of Enoch. According to this text, the Watchers were a group of fallen angels who descended to Earth, bringing with them knowledge and technology.

In return for humanity's worship and their daughters, the Watchers taught humans various arts and sciences, including agriculture, architecture, and metallurgy. The Watchers produced the Nephilim – a hybrid species of giant, powerful beings (Genesis 6:1-4) who subjugated humanity.

Similarly, ARPA/DARPA can be seen as a modern-day equivalent of the Watchers. Just as they brought knowledge and technology to humanity, ARPA/DARPA has funded research projects that have transformed the world.

In both cases, the "watchers" (whether angels or human researchers) bring about significant changes to human society through their knowledge and technology. These parallels highlight the power dynamics at play when humans seek knowledge and power.

## Current Technology Companies: The New Nephelium?

Fast-forward to today, where technology companies like Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Apple are shaping the modern world with their innovative products and services. These companies have become powerful forces in society, influencing the way we communicate, work, and live.

They're now exploring ways to merge man with machine, literally inserting chips into our brains to create a new kind of human. These modern-day "Watchers”(DARPA) and their offspring (Big Tech) bring about significant changes to human society through their technological innovations. They're not necessarily angels or fallen ones, but we exchange our soul as meta data so that we can use their technology. As we surrender more of ourselves to these digital overlords, they're creating a new paradigm where humans are no longer just users of technology but become an integrated into the system itself.


## Conclusion

The story of ARPA/DARPA and its evolution into modern technology companies serves as a reminder of the complex interplay between knowledge, power, and innovation. Just as the Watchers in the Enochian account brought about significant changes to human society through their knowledge and technology, so too do modern-day technology companies shape our world with their “innovative” products and services.

In the past few years, we have been able to see how this kind of information can be used to control what we say, how we purchase goods and services and how quickly we can be depersoned and excluded from using their technology or subjugated.

By understanding the historical context and the power dynamics at play, and how centralized the technology really is and the history of ARPA/DARPA, we can better understand where we are being lead. 
Maybe instead of reading Facebook, Instagram, or X you pickup a Bible and start reading it, then go outside and talk to your neighbor. 
Your soul is at stake.
