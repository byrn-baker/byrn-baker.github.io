## How do you define the word love?
As our nation grapples with cultural divisions, polarization, and secularization, the concept of love is often reduced to mere sentimentality or emotional attachment. We're more likely to focus on human experiences, social constructs, and power dynamics than on the transcendent, eternal nature of Gods love.

However, when we shift our understanding of love from a narrow, secular perspective to Jesus' teachings, we're met with a profound transformation that can bridge even the widest chasms of disagreement. By embracing His teachings on love, we can discover a love that's:
- **Unconditional**: loving one's neighbor as oneself (Mark 12:31)
- **Eternal**: reflecting God's love for us (1 John 4:7-12)
- **Sacrificial**: laying down one's life for friends (John 15:13)

## Restoring the Dialectic

In a secular context, the dialectic of love looks like this:
- Love → Possessiveness → Control → Heartbreak
- Love → Fears and doubts → Disillusionment

But when we shift our understanding to Jesus' teachings, the dialectic changes:
- Love → Sacrifice → Freedom → Eternal Life
- Love → Obedience → Joy → Harmony with God

## Practicing Sacred Love

So, how can we practice this transformed understanding of love in our daily lives? Here are a few suggestions:
1. **Choose to love**: Make a conscious decision to put others first, even when it's hard.
2. **Sacrifice for others**: Lay down your own desires and interests for the sake of those around you.
3. **Practice loving rebuke**: Treat others with kindness, compassion, speaking the truth in love (Ephesians 4:15). This means being willing to confront sin and encourage repentance, even if it's uncomfortable. 
4. **Seek eternal life through Jesus**: Prioritize building relationships that reflect God's love for us, and invite others to follow Jesus' teachings, which offer redemption from sin and the promise of eternal life (John 3:16-17). This means being willing to share the gospel with others and encouraging them to put their faith in Jesus.

## Loving Rebuke
When we practice "loving rebuke" it means being kind, and showing compassion while also speaking the truth in love. This doesn't mean ignoring or excusing people's sinful behavior. Rather, it means addressing the root issues of sin and encouraging repentance, just as Jesus did.

Accountability for wrongdoing is essential, Jesus taught that we should love our neighbors and that we're called to live in obedience to God's laws (John 14:15-17). When people break these laws or engage in sinful behavior, they need to be held accountable. This is not revenge and should be constrained by doing good which conquers evil (Romans 12:19-21).

## In Conclusion

Shifting our understanding of love from a secular to a sacred perspective can be a game-changer. By embracing Jesus' teachings on love, we can experience the transformative power of unconditional, eternal, and sacrificial love.  Let's choose to push the Overton window back into alignment with Jesus teaching and Gods love.
